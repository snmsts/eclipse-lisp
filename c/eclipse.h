 *
 * N.B.  This is not Lisp!  Similarities between the names of
 * operators defined here and those in Lisp are only to remind us of
 * how the operators are used.  They do not simply indicate a C SYNTAX
 * for a Lisp construction.  Nothing in here should be assumed to have
 * the same SEMANTICS as a Lisp operation with a similar name.
 *
 * To call most of the functions in the library from C, you need to
 * understand only the following:
 *
 * 1. Naming convention.  This is described in a separate document,
 *    but the most important thing is that the C functions
 *    corresponding to Lisp functions are prefixed with "cl", the
 *    first letter of each word in the Lisp name is capitalized, and
 *    the dashes are removed.  For example: CONS => clCons,
 *    SYMBOL-VALUE => clSymbolValue
 *
 * 2. The arguments to the C functions are the same as the arguments
 *    to the Lisp functions, including optional and named arguments.
 *    The only difference is that the arguments must be terminated
 *    with the symbol clEOA (end-of-arguments).  For example, 
 *       (LIST A B C) => clList(a, b, c, clEOA).
 *
 *    Some functions which take a fixed number of arguments and
 *    return a single value also have an "internal" C function
 *    which does not require clEOA, does no argument checking
 *    (including type checking), and does not produce multiple values.
 *    The name of the internal version begins with an underscore.  For
 *    example, (FOO A) => clFoo(a, clEOA) or _clFoo(a).  The internal
 *    utility may actually be implemented as a function-like C macro
 *    rather than as a C function.
 *
 * 3. All arguments and return values to a library Lisp function are
 *    of a single C data type: clObject.  Functions are provided for
 *    creating various Lisp clObjects from C primitives such as int
 *    and float, and for extracting C primitives from some Lisp
 *    clObjects.
 *
 *    The internal versions of some functions (i.e. the _versions), do
 *    take C primitives directly.
 *
 * To write "Lisp functions" in C, or to use Lisp constructs such as
 * closures, multiple values, the dynamic environment or nonlocal
 * exits, you need to read more about the naming convention, and about
 * the special constructs defined in this file.
 *
 * Included are:
 *    PART I: DATA REPRESENTATION
 *    PART II: FUNCTION CALLS
 *    PART III: EXITS AND THE DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT

 *********************************************************************
 *		     PART I: DATA REPRESENTATION
 *		     ---------------------------
 *
 * Most Lisp data is kept in C structures which we generically call
 * cells.  A Lisp clObject is usually a pointer to one of these cells.
 * Depending on whether data is word aligned (4-byte) or double word
 * aligned (8-byte), the two or three low order bits of these pointers
 * will always be clear. 
 *
 * The first member in most cells is a data tag which identifies
 * the type of the object.  We say such data types are DATA-TAGGED
 * because they carry a type-identifying tag in a known place in the
 * data cell.  (The current implementatin uses clObjects -- class
 * metaobjects -- as data tags.)  
 *
 * There are some data types which do not have a data tag.  We
 * distinguish these objects by using the low two or three bits in the
 * pointer as a tag.  We call these POINTER-TAGGED data types.  We can
 * determine the type of pointer-tagged data without dereferencing a
 * pointer, which can be an advantage.  On the other hand, to examine
 * the actual data, we must mask off or otherwise suppress the tag
 * bits.  (The means of "otherwise suppressing" the tag bits is a
 * programming issue, not generally a performance one.)  Sometimes
 * pointer-tagged data representations are used when the non-tag data
 * occupies exactly 8 bytes and we don't want the allocated memory for
 * the object to increase to 12 or 16 bytes because of the tag.
 *
 * Some Lisp data types such as fixnums and characters are small
 * enough that, together with the three tag bits, they can fit in the
 * same size clWord as is used for pointers to cells.  These are
 * called IMMEDIATE DATA, as the data is found directly in the clWord
 * and no pointer need be followed.  Again, the low two or three bits
 * are used to distinguish these from other kinds of data.  Some
 * immediate data may have additional tag bits which distinguish
 * between different kinds of immediate data.
 *
 * Thus all Lisp clObjects are a machine clWord which, depending on
 * the tag bits, may be interpreted as either immediate data of some
 * kind, a pointer-tagged pointer to a cell, or a pointer to a
 * data-tagged cell.
 *********************************************************************/

/* When an object cell WITHOUT a data tag occupies a multiple of the
 * machine alignment size, then including a data tag would make its
 * size jump to the next multiple.  We want to avoid this on
 * double-word aligned systems, so these system use pointer tagging
 * for cons and double float cells.

 * Object definition.  
 *
 * The cl_CTYPECHECKS version allows for very strict compiler/lint type
 * checking of pointer casts.  It defines clObject as a union of
 * types.  Some utilities which lint has trouble with are packaged
 * into functions.  
 *
 * N.B.: compiling with cl_CTYPECHECKS defined does not currently work!
 *
 * Unfortunately, some linters complain about the casts introduced by
 * va_start(), which we use in BeginParse(), and which can't be
 * abstracted into a function.  However, the LINT version turns these
 * into no-ops, which of course, won't compile into anything useful,
 * but should lint cleanly.
 *
 * The non-cl_CTYPECHECKS version defines clObject as a pointer to an
 * object cell and makes frequent uses of casts which some versions of
 * lint warn about, though all C compilers support.
 *
 * For MOST, but NOT ALL C compilers, the machine representation of
 * clObjects is the same in both cases.  
 *
 * N.B.: Not all compilers on the same platform return unions the same
 * way.  In particular, gcc may return cl_CTYPECHECKS clObjects
 * differently than PCC does.  Therefore, when compiling with
 * cl_CTYPECHECKS, all Eclipse files, including both user and system
 * code, must be compiled with the same compiler.  (In the case of
 * gcc, the -fpcc-struct-return compiler option can be specified to
 * force PCC compatible clObject returns.)
 *
 * Operations:
 *  clObjectTag(obj:clObject) => clPointerTagCell
 *   EFFECTS: Access the complete clObject as a tag, for reading or
 *     writing. 
 *
 *  clObjectWord(obj:clObject) => clWord
 *   EFFECTS: Access the complete clObject as a clWord, for reading or
 *     writing.  
 *
 * clObjectAddress(obj:clObject) => clObjectCell *
 *   EFFECTS: Access the complete clObject as a pointer to an
 *     clObjectCell, for reading or writing.  Note that the pointer
 *     will not actually be valid if obj is an immediate or pointer
 *     tagged object.
 *
 *  clSetq(place:clObject, value: clObject) => x:clObject
 *   REQUIRES: place is a writable clObject location (variable, struct
 *     member, etc.).
 *   EFFECTS: Stores value in place and returns it.  
 *   RATIONALE: Using the cl_CTYPECHECKS representation, place = value;
 *     will not work.  Also, use of clSetq() emphasizes that the place
 *     being written to is an clObject location (as opposed to an int
 *     or something else), and makes C code look more like Lisp code.
 *     Note, however, that lisp SETQ takes any number of place/value
 *     pairs, whereas clSetq() takes only one pair.
 *
 *  clMakeHeapObject(size:unsigned) => clObject
 *   EFFECTS: Returns an uninitialized heap object of the specified
 *     size. size might be computed, for example, as
 *     sizeof(clSymbolCell).

 * DATA-TAGGED objects
 *
 * The clObject is a pointer to an clObjectCell.  As far as the
 * pointer-tagged object operations are concerned, all data-tagged
 * objects look like pointer-tagged object with cl_DATA_TAG as the
 * pointer tag.  The "real" tag is kept in the data being pointed to.
 *
 * Implementation:
 *
 * We use cl_DATA_TAG=0, so the pointers can always be dereferenced
 * without supressing pointer tag bits.  
 * N.B. This may change in later versions.
 *
 * The first field of the data cell is a clDataTag that represents an
 * clObject (a class metaobject) and possibly other information.
 *
 * Operations:
 *
 * clDataTagObjectCell(obj:clObject) => (clObjectCell *)
 *   REQUIRES: obj is a data tagged object.
 *   EFFECTS: returns a pointer to the clObjectCell represented by obj. 
 *
 * clTaggedInstanceClass(obj:clObject) => clObject
 *   REQUIRES: obj must be a data tagged object.
 *   EFFECTS: Returns the tag (i.e. class metaobject) of obj.
 *
 * clSetTaggedInstanceClass(obj:clObject, class:clObject) => class
 *   REQUIRES: obj must be a data tagged object, class must be a class.
 *   EFFECTS: Makes class be reported as the class for obj.
 *
 * clObjectClass(obj:clObject) => clObject
 *   REQUIRES: obj expression must not produce side-effects.
 *   EFFECTS: Returns the tag (i.e. class metaobject) of obj,
 *     regardless of whether the object 
 *     is immediate, pointer tagged, or data tagged.
 *   IMPLEMENTATION: clObjectClass() first checks the 2 or 3 low order
 *     bits.  If zero, it gets the clObjectDataTag().  Otherwise, it
 *     uses those bits as an index into an array of class objects.  
 *********************************************************************/
/* The tag field of a data tagged clObjectCell is actually a little
 * more complicated than just an clObject because:
 *  1. We might want the field to have the same alignment as the fields
 *     of a cons so we can play games with treating the first two clWords
 *     of conses and the symbol NIL as identical in format.
 *  2. We may someday want to use unused bits of the clTagCell for
 *     other purposes.
 *  Note that this doesn't cost us anything for most data types as the
 *  field following the tag in an clObjectCell is most likely to
 *  require word alignment anyway.
 *  3. The clTagCell might actually contain both a class (clObject) and
 *     a wrapper (clObject).

 *
 * Symbols are the basic identifiers in Lisp programs.  A symbol is

 *
 * References to a symbol as an identifier for a global function

 *
 * Operations:
 *
 * _clSymbolName(obj:clObject) => clObject
 *   REQUIRES: obj is a symbol.
 *   EFFECTS: Accesses the symbol name for reading or writing.
 *

 *     assigned is consistent with the package system.
 *   EFFECTS: Accesses the symbol package for reading or writing.  A
 *     values of clNIL indicates that the symbol is not interned in

 *
 * _clSymbolValue(obj:clObject) => clObject
 *   REQUIRES: obj is a symbol.
 *   EFFECTS: Accesses the symbol value for reading or writing.  The

 * SIMPLE VECTORS
 * 
 * Simple vectors have a length and a homogeneous array of C types.
 * - clSimpleVector is an array of any clObjects
 * - clSimpleBaseString elements are char representing BASE-CHAR
 * - clSimpleString elements are wchar_t representing CHARACTER
 * - clSimpleBitVector is an array of clDigit representing bundles of
 *   bits.   
 * All specialized vectors must create a clObject when elements are
 * accessed in the interpreter, though compiled code may be more
 * efficient. 
 *
 * Other specialized types may be defined in the future.
 *
 * Implementation:
 * All the simple vectors have the same first two structure elements,
 * so that the tag and length can be extracted without regard to type.
 *
 * clSimpleBaseString and clSimpleString are null terminated ('\0'),
 * even though this is not needed within any Eclipse functions.  This
 * allows C programs to easily manipulate Eclipse string data directly
 * without needing to make copies.  Note, though, that like all simple
 * arrays in Common Lisp, clSimpleBaseString and clSimpleString do not
 * have fill pointers.  The fill pointer operations on complex vectors
 * do NOT set the character pointed to by the fill-pointer to be
 * '\0'.  
 *
 * Operations:
 * 
 * clVectorSize(v:clObject) => clIndex
 *   REQUIRES: v is a simple vector (specialized or not).
 *   EFFECTS: Returns the length (i.e. number of elements
 *     stored/storable) in v.  This does not include any null
 *     termination that may be used by the implementation.
 *
 * clSimpleVectorSlots(v:clObject) => clSlots
 *   REQUIRES: v is an unspecialized simple vector.
 *   EFFECTS: Returns a pointer to the first element of the vector.
 * 
 * clGeneralElt(v:clObject, i:clIndex) => clObject
 *   REQUIRES: v is an unspecialized simple-vector.
 *   EFFECTS: Returns the element at index i.
 *
 * clSetGeneralElt(v:clObject, i:clIndex, n:clObject) => n
 *   REQUIRES: v is an unspecialized simple-vector.
 *   EFFECTS: Assigns n to the element at index i.
 *
 * clSimpleBaseStringCharp(v:clObject) => char *
 *   REQUIRES: v is simple base string.
 *   EFFECTS: Returns a pointer to the first element of the vector.
 *
 * clBaseCharElt(v:clObject, i:clIndex) => char
 *   REQUIRES: v is a simple-base-string.
 *   EFFECTS: Returns the element at index i.
 *
 * clSetBaseCharElt(v:clObject, i:clIndex, n:char) => n

 *   of bits in the vector.
 *
 * clIndexref(v:clObject, i:clIndex) => clIndex
 *   REQUIRES: v is simple-bit-vector.
 *   EFFECTS: Returns the element at index i, with v treated as an array
 *     of digits.
 *
 * clSetIndexref(v:clObject, i:clIndex, n:clIndex) => n
 *   REQUIRES: v is a simple-bit-vector.
 *   EFFECTS: Assigns n to the element at index i, with v treated as an

 * Lisp function which has been machine compiled, there is one
 * clMFunction which "does the work" of that function.
 *
 * A Lisp function object is a tagged object which can be created at
 * runtime, examined, printed, stored in variables, and passed as the
 * first argument to the functions clFuncall and clApply.  We
 * represent a Lisp function object as a clClosureCell which records
 * the type tag and the "implementing" clMFunction.  In part,
 * clFuncall works by calling the clMFunction from the clClosureCell
 * on the arguments that clFuncall is given.
 *
 * Lisp functions can be defined inside other functions, and the inner
 * definition can refer to lexical variables defined in the enclosing
 * function.  C function definitions, though, may not be nested, and
 * the C compiler can only resolve lexical references to the current
 * (inner) function -- i.e. it can only compute access to that part of
 * the stack defined by the function itself.
 *
 * If a C function needs to refer to C variables which correspond to
 * Lisp variables defined by the enclosing Lisp function, it must make
 * use of a captured lexical environment representation.
 *
 * The captured lexical environment represents the bindings in the
 * enclosing functions, not just their values.  For example, if a
 * binding is written to using clSetq() in the inner function, the value
 * of the binding in the outer function changes as well.
 *
 * Both a clMFunction and a (possibly empty) captured lexical
 * environment is necessary to fully represent a Lisp function.  The
 * clMFunction is written so as to make use of the captured lexical 
 * environment, if necessary, as stored in the closure.
 *
 * There are two interesting special cases to point out:
 *
 * 1. Consider a function which contains a loop which iterates 10
 *    times.  Within the loop, several new local variables are stack
 *    allocated.  Each time through the loop, a local function is
 *    defined which captures these new variables.  The loop then
 *    produces 10 closures, each of which captures a different set of
 *    lexical variables.  The code for each local function is the
 *    same, only the captured bindings are different.  Accordingly,
 *    only one clMFunction is defined, which is refered to by each of
 *    the 10 different clClosureCells.
 *
 * 2. The interpreter is an clMFunction.  It is designed to execute
 *    Lisp code, stored in the captured lexical environment.  Thus all
 *    Lisp interpreted function objects are clClosureCells which have
 *    the same clMFunction (the interpreter) as the stored function,
 *    and a list representation of the particular Lisp function code
 *    stored in some element of the captured lexical environment.
 *    Byte-compiled code is similar.
 *
 * Implementation:
 *
 * The captured lexical environment is an array of clBindings --
 * addresses of locations which hold clObjects.  A clClosureCell
 * includes a (possibly 0 length) array of clBindings to represent the
 * captured lexical environment.
 *
 * We could require that the environment array be passed as an
 * additional argument to the function.  However, anyone writting C
 * code which called the function directly would then have to know
 * whether or not to pass in this extra argument, and it would be poor
 * modularity for callers to have to know how a function was
 * implemented.  Instead we place a pointer to the first clBinding of
 * the environment array in a known place, unique for each clMFunction,
 * which the clMFunction knows how to gain access to.  In most cases,
 * this evironment hook never changes.  However, in the special cases
 * enumerated above, the environment does change for different
 * executions of the clMFunction.  We don't require the user to go
 * around setting this hook, but instead, we have the system functions
 * which access closures do the setting.
 *
 * Each clClosureCell stores the address of the environment hook for
 * the clMFunction.  (ex. Different closures which use the same
 * clMFunction will use the same stored environment hook address.)
 * The functions clApply(), clFuncall() and _clSetSymbolFunction()
 * each receive a closure object as an argument.  Each updates the
 * hook address specified by the closure with the address of the first
 * clBinding of the closure.  (clApply() and clFuncall() effectively
 * BIND the hook.  i.e. they set it before calling the clMFunction,
 * and reset it to the old value after the function completes.  This
 * ensures that distinct closures which use the same implementing C
 * function can call each other.)
 *
 * Operations:
 *
 * clClosureFunction(obj:clObject) => clMFunction
 *   REQUIRES: obj is a closure.
 *   EFFECTS: Returns the clMFunction which implements the closure.
 *
 * clClosureEnvironment(obj:clObject) => clBinding[]
 *   REQUIRES: obj is a closure with a non-empty captured lexical
 *     environment. 
 *   EFFECTS: Returns the address of the first clBinding in the
 *     captured lexical environment. 
 *
 * clClosureHook(obj:clObject) => clBinding **
 *   REQUIRES: obj is a closure.
 *   EFFECTS: Returns the address of the environment hook, i.e. the
 *     place where the clMFunction will expect to find the address of
 *     the first clBinding in the captured lexical environment.  This
 *     will be a clNULL_HOOK if the closure does not use a captured
 *     lexical environment. 
 *
 * clMakeClosure(n:unsigned, f:clMFunction, h:clBinding **,
 *               b0:clBinding, b1:clBinding, ...) => clObject
 *   REQUIRES: The number of bn arguments is n.  h is the address of
 *     the environment hook used by f.  f uses exactly n captured
 *     variables. 
 *   EFFECTS: Returns an clObject representing the specified closure.
 *     The location pointed to by h is initialized to point to the
 *     start of the environment within the closure.   
 *   NOTES:
 *     If f does not make use of a captured lexical environment
 *       (i.e. n=0), h may be clNULL_HOOK.  
 *   EXAMPLE: 
 *   { clObject f, x, y, *z=clMakeBinding(); int i = 4;
 *     clSetq(x, clIntFixnum(1));
 *     clSetq(y, clIntFixnum(2));
 *     clSetq(*z, clIntFixnum(3));
 *     clSetq(f, clMakeClosure(4, usrFoo, &clEnvHook(usrFoo),
 *                             &x, &y, z, (clBinding) &i)); 
 *     ... }
 *     Note that the other pointers may be cast to clBindings.
 *
 * N.B. Closures are immutable objects, and the implementation is free
 * to make copies of closures at any time. Specifically, if some C
 * program manipulates the closure fields within some closure, these
 * changes will not necessarilly propogate to all existing uses of
 * that closure.

 *		       PART II: FUNCTION CALLS
 *		       -----------------------
 *********************************************************************/
/*********************************************************************
 * FUNCTION CALLS
 *
 * A typical C function definition for the Lisp function USER:FOO is:
 *
 *   clObject usrFoo(...) ... { ... }
 *
 * One can call usrFoo() directly, as in usrFoo(a, b, clEOA).
 *
 * It is also possible to completely machine compile an entire
 * application which includes calls to functions which are not (and
 * perhaps never will be) machine compiled.  In this case, it is
 * necessary to call the function in C as: clCall(usrFOO)(a, b,
 * clEOA).  This indirects through the closure stored in the
 * symbol-function slot of the symbol usrFOO.
 *
 * Implementation:
 *
 * clCall() is used when the highest safety level is specied by the
 * user, when the function is declared NOTINLINE, or when the function
 * being called is neither defined earlier in the file being compiled
 * nor as a machine function in the Lisp which is doing the compilation.
 * Otherwise, the call is made directly to the C function:
 * ex. usrFoo(..., clEOA).  However, if the function FOO is redefined,
 * existing machine compiled calls will not see the new definition.  
 *
 * Internal Calls:
 *
 * When internal calls are permitted and the compiler judges a
 * function definition to be internalizable, it may generate two
 * machine functions:
 *
 *   some_type _usrFoo(...) ... { ... }
 *   clObject usrFoo(...) ... { ... _usrFoo(...) ... }
 *   clDeclareHook(usrFoo);
 *
 * The internal function, _usrFoo() takes a fixed number of arguments
 * and returns a single value through the normal C function call
 * mechanism.  In addition, arguments and the returned value may be C
 * primitive types instead of Lisp Objects.  The normal function,
 * usrFoo(), calls the internal one, _usrFoo().
 *
 * When direct calls AND internal calls are permitted AND the compiler
 * agrees, a call to FOO will be compiled as _usrFoo(...).  This saves
 * argument parsing and may save "boxing" (heap allocation) of values.
 * No runtime checking of the type or number of arguments is
 * performed.  As with normal direct calls, machine compiled calls
 * will not see new definitions for FOO.
 *
 * Operations:
 *
 * clCall(symbol:clObject)(arg1:clObject, arg2:clObject, ..., clEOA) 
 *     => clObject 
 *   REQUIRES: symbol is a symbol. Evaluating symbol has no side-effects.
 *     The expressions that make op arg1, arg2, ..., argn must not
 *     involve any other uses of clCall, either directly or
 *     indirectly.  In practice, this means that each argument must be
 *     a reference to a temporary variable.  
 *   SIGNALS: Control-error if symbol is not fbound.
 *   EFFECTS: Calls the specified function on the given arguments,
 *     returning the result.  This will work even if symbol is not
 *     given a function until runtime.

/*********************************************************************
 * ARGUMENT PARSING 
 * 
 * To support optional, named and collected arguments (&optional, &key
 * and &rest in Lisp), all C functions corresponding to Lisp functions
 * are called with arguments terminating in clEOA and are defined
 * using variable argument syntax.
 * 
 * Example: The following function takes one required argument named
 * arg, an optional argument opt, with a default value of 1, and a
 * named argument x, with a default value of 2.  If arg is not
 * supplied, clMissingArgs() is called.  If, after the required and
 * optional arguments are specified, a named argument other than X is
 * supplied, clCheckKeys() triggers an error.
 *
 * clObject clFoo clVdecl(_ap)
 * { clObject arg, opt, opt_p, x_p, x, keys, tmp;
 *   { clBeginParse(_ap);
 *     clSetq(arg, clVp(_ap) ? clVpop(_ap) : clMissingArgs());
 *     clSetq(opt,  ? clVpop(_ap) : I_1);
 *     clSetq(keys, clVp(_ap) : clVargs(_ap));
 *     clSetq(tmp, clKeyArg(keyX, keys, clEOA));
 *     clSetq(x, clTrue(tmp ? clCar(tmp, clEOA) : I_2));
 *     clCheckKeys(keys, clList(keyX, clEOA));  
 *     clEndParse(_ap); }
 *    ... }
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES: Curent Eclipse code generation uses
 * "(clVaAlist) clVaDcl" rather than clVdecl(id).  clVaAlist
 * "hardwires" '_ap' as the id.  When clVaAlist is used, id must be
 * _ap when using other parsing macros in the same function.
 * 
 * Operations:
 *
 * clVdecl(id:variable_name)
 *   EFFECTS: Declares a C parameter list in a Lisp function
 *     definition.
 *   IMPLEMENTATION EFFECTS: See clBeginParse().
 *
 * clBeginParse(id:variable_name)
 *   REQUIRES: Only declaration statements can precede clBeginParse()
 *     in the enclosing code block.  Id must be unique with respect to
 *     variables of overlapping scope, and must match id in a
 *     clVdecl() for the current function.
 *   EFFECTS: Sets up argument parsing.
 *   IMPLEMENTATION EFFECTS: In conjuction with clVdecl(), defines an
 *     clObject variable named clCurrentArg(id) and initializes it to
 *     the first argument. May also define an clObject variable named
 *     clArgTmp(id). 
 *
 * clEndParse(id:variable_name)
 *   REQUIRES: id matches that used in clBeginParse() in the same code
 *     block. 
 *   EFFECTS: Ends argument parsing.
 * 
 * clVp(id:variable_name) => clObject
 *   REQUIRES: id matches that used in clBeginParse() in the same code
 *     block. 
 *   EFFECTS: Returns true if an unpopped variable argument is
 *     present.
 *
 * clVpop(id:variable_name) => clObject
 *   REQUIRES: An unpopped variable argument must be available, as
 *     tested by clVp(id).
 *   EFFECTS: Returns the next variable argument.
 *   MODIFIES: The variable argument machinery is effected such that
 *     the next call to clVp(id) will test whether an argument
 *     immediately after the one being popped is present.
 *
 * clVargs(id:variable_name) => clObject
 *   REQUIRES:  An unpopped variable argument must be available, as

/*********************************************************************
 * ENCLOSED ENVIRONMENTS
 *
 * All calling mechanisms (even direct and internal calls) are
 * independent of whether the called function happens to make use of
 * variables from the defining environment.
 *
 * Here is a typical C function definition for the Lisp function
 * USER:FOO which uses variables from its defining environment:
 *
 *   clDeclareEnv(Foo);
 *   clObject usrFoo(...) ...
 *   { clUseEnvironment(Foo);
 *     ... }
 *
 * Within the body of usrFoo(), clObjects in the captured lexical
 * environment may be referenced as clEnv(0, x), clEnv(1, y), etc.,
 * for the first clObject in the enclosed environment (which happens to
 * be named x), the second clObject (named y), etc.
 *
 * Data of types other than clObject can be captured in the
 * environment.  To reference them, one uses clCEnv(type, n), where
 * type is the type of the data captured.
 *
 * Dynamic-extent vs Indefinite-extent Variables:
 * 
 * The clBindings might just be the addresses of the local variables
 * in the outer function.  These are called dynamic extent variables
 * -- their extent (validity) ends when the defining code block ends
 * and the variables are "popped" from the C stack.
 *
 * However, a clClosureCell may be created and RETURNED from a
 * function.  It may then be applied or funcalled later.  In this case
 * any closed over variables must have indefinite extent -- they must
 * still be valid even after the function which first defined the
 * variables has ended.  In this case, the local variables in the
 * outer function must not simply be of type clObject, but (clObject
 * *).  We must heap allocate a clBinding to hold the pointer to the
 * clObject data.
 *
 * Operations:
 *
 * clEnv(n:unsigned, id) => clObject
 *   REQUIRES: The current function calls clUseEnvironment(), the
 *     environment defined for the current function has at least n
 *     captured bindings, and the nth binding (0 based) holds an
 *     clObject.
 *   EFFECTS: Returns the value of the nth binding from the
 *     environment for reading or writing.  (i.e. clSetq() may be used
 *     with clEnv() as the first argument.)  The ordering referred to
 *     by n is the same as the order presented to clMakeClosure(). id is
 *     ignored and serves as documentation. 
 *
 * clCEnv(val_type:type_name, n:unsigned) => value:val_type
 *   REQUIRES: The current function calls clUseEnvironment(), the
 *     environment defined for the current function has at least n
 *     captured bindings, and the nth binding (0 based) hold data of
 *     type val_type.
 *   EFFECTS: Returns the value of the nth binding from the environment
 *     for reading or writing.  (i.e. If the = operator is acceptable
 *     for data of type val_type, then = may be used with clCEnv() as
 *     the left-hand-side.)  The ordering referred to by n is the same
 *     as the order presented to for clMakeClosure().
 *   
 * clUseEnv(id:function_name)
 *   REQUIRES: clDeclareEnv(id) is used for a matching id.  Only
 *     declaration statements can precede clUseEnv() within the function
 *     in which it appears.
 *   EFFECTS: Sets up the environment within the function id() so that
 *     clEnv() and clCEnv() will work.  
 *   IMPLEMENTATION EFFECTS: clUseEnv() is defined so as to cache the
 *     address of the first clBinding when it is called, for later use
 *     by clEnv()/clCEnv().  This ensures the function will work
 *     properly even if the current clMFunction (or some functin that it
 *     calls) creates a new and different closure which happens to also
 *     use the same clMFunction.  In fact, since the environment address
 *     is cached as a lexical C varible in the funtion, it will be
 *     "reset" properly if a transfer to an exit sends us back to an
 *     earlier invokation of a function which has had its environment

 *

 *   REQUIRES: id is an identifier denoting a C function.
 *     clDeclareEnv() must appear at top level in the C file (i.e. like

 *   EFFECTS: Establishes a static hook pointing to the environment for
 *     the specified function. clMakeClosure() initialize this variable
 *     to point to the captured lexical environment in which the C
 *     function is to be run.
 *
 * clMakeBinding() => clBinding

 *   USAGE: { clObject *x = clMakeBinding(); ...} Now *x can be used
 *     exactly like any lexical clObject variable, with the additional
 *     benefit that a closure over *x (i.e. clMakeClosure(n, f, h,
 *     &*x, ...) or simply clMakeClosure(n, f, h, x, ...)) will
 *     continue to work even after the extent of *x has ended.

/*********************************************************************
 * MULTIPLE VALUES
 *
 * Instead of always returning one value, Lisp defines certain
 * functions and constructs for producing zero or more values, and
 * certain constructs for receiving these values.
 *
 * In some sense, all Lisp functions and constructs always produce
 * multiple values, though in fact, the NUMBER of "multiple" values is
 * usually one. When these values are to be assigned to a variable or
 * passed as an argument to a function, only the first value -- the
 * primary value -- is used.  In most other cases, a construct passes
 * on all the values produced by some subexpression.
 *
 * Eclipse uses the normal C evaluation and return mechanism to pass
 * the primary value.  For example, C functions implementing Lisp
 * functions return one clObject through the normal C return
 * mechanism.  This is the primary value.
 *
 * The other values (if any) are maintained by the internal multiple
 * values machinery, and are visible only through the constructs
 * defined for receiving multiple values.  Eclipse simulates the
 * passing of multiple values dynamically -- the most recent multiple
 * values produced are the ones seen by any receiving construct.
 *
 * The function clValues() produces multiple values, one for each
 * argument.  It returns the primary value through the normal C return
 * mechanism.  clValues1() is a more efficient version for the single
 * argument case.  All true Lisp functions, even those written in C,
 * should use one of these to produce multiple values.  Note, though,
 * that such functions can rely on all other Lisp functions to produce
 * multiple values.  For example, the following definition is fine:
 *
 * clObject MyFunction(x) clObject x;
 * { if (_clNull(x)) return(clValues1(clNIL));
 *   else if (_clSymbolp(x)) return(clValues(x, CLT, clEOA));
 *   else return(SomeOtherFunction(x)); }
 *
 * If x is NIL, clValues1() is used to produce one "multiple" value.
 * If x is a different symbol, clValues() is used to produce two
 * multiple values.  Otherwise, SomeOtherFunction() is called.  We
 * rely on SomeOtherFunction to obey the rules and produce multiple
 * values itself.  In all cases, a single primary clObject value is
 * returned through the normal C return mechanism.  Also, in each
 * case, the last values produced (by clValues1(), clValues(), or
 * SomeOtherFunction()) before returning to MyFunction's caller are
 * the ones which will be seen by any receiving constructs in the
 * caller.
 *
 * One way to make use of multiple values is to collect them up as
 * arguments to a function.  (Remember that usually a function only
 * sees the primary value of each argument expression.)
 * clMultipleValueCall() arranges this.
 *
 * Implementation:
 *
 * Multiple values are always written to an array of clObjects
 * pointed to by the global variable CL_current_values.  We could have
 * a null CL_current_values indicate that multiple values are not to
 * be produced, but since clValues1() is used so frequently, we want
 * it to be as small and quick as possible, so it doesn't do any
 * branching.
 *
 * clMultipleValueProg1() and clMultipleValueCall() both establish new
 * stack-allocated arrays for accumulating values.
 *
 * MULTIPLE-VALUE-PROG1 begins using the new (junk) buffer after the
 * first form has been evaluated, and restores the CL_current_values
 * variable to point to its original buffer after the last form has
 * been evaluated.  The contents of the junk buffer are never read by
 * anyone.
 *
 * MULTIPLE-VALUE-CALL begins using the new buffer immediately.  After
 * each argument form, it advances the CL_current_values pointer to
 * the next available element in the buffer, checking that
 * CALL-ARGUMENTS-LIMIT has not been exceeded.  Finally, we call the
 * function with the accumulated data.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * The following code saves the value produced by usrFoo() and ignores
 * the values produced by usrBar().  The net effect on the multiple
 * values machinery is that only the values produced by usrFoo() are
 * retained as "the most recent values produced"
 *
 * { clMultipleValueProg1(t_MVP);
 *   usrFoo(clEOA);		// <- values produced here are saved
 *   clSaveValues(t_MVP);
 *   usrBar(clEOA);		// <- values produced here are discarded 
 *   clRestoreValues(t_MVP); }
 * 
 * The following code adds up all the values returned by usrBar(clEOA)
 * and clValues1(I_3). 
 *
 * { clMultipleValueCall(t_MVC);
 *   usrBar(clEOA);
 *   clAccumulateValues(t_MVC);
 *   clValues1(I_3);
 *   clAccumulateValues(t_MVC);
 *   return(clMultipleValueMcall(t_MVC, clPLUSFUNC)); } 
 *
 * Operations:
 *
 * clValues(v0:clObject, v1:clObject, ..., clEOA) => clObject
 *   EFFECTS: Returns the first argument, if any.  If there are no
 *     arguments (i.e. only clEOA is supplied), then clNIL is
 *     returned.  In addition, all of the arguments (including the
 *     first) are retained by the multiple values machinery as "the
 *     most recently produced" multiple values.
 *
 * clValues1(v:clObject) => v
 *   EFFECTS: Equivalent to clValues(v, clEOA), but may be more
 *     efficient. 
 *
 * clMultipleValueProg1(id:label)
 *   REQUIRES: Only declaration statements can precede
 *     clMultipleValueProg1() in the enclosing code block.  Id must be
 *     unique with respect to clMultipleValueProg1 id's of overlapping
 *     scope.
 *   EFFECTS: Marks the start of a region of code which will produce
 *     multiple values.  
 *
 * clSaveValues(id:label)
 *   REQUIRES: id must match that used in a clMultipleValueProg1() in
 *     the same code block.
 *   IMPLEMENTATION MODIFIES: CL_current_values.
 *   EFFECTS: Marks the end of a region of code which produces
 *     multiple values.  The values previously produced are saved for
 *     use with clRestoreValues(). 
 *   IMPLEMENTATION EFFECTS: Sets CL_current_values pointer to point
 *     to the junk values buffer established by
 *     clMultipleValueProg1(), so that any new multiple values
 *     produced are written to the junk buffer.
 *
 * clRestoreValues(id:label)
 *   REQUIRES: id must match that used in a clSaveValues() in the same
 *     code block.
 *   IMPLEMENTATION MODIFIES: CL_current_values.
 *   EFFECTS: Restores the values saved by the matching
 *     clSaveValues(). 
 *   IMPLEMENTATION EFFECTS: Sets CL_current_values pointer to point
 *     back to its original value before the current
 *     clMultipleValueProg1(). 
 *
 * clMultipleValueCall(id:label)
 *   REQUIRES: Only declaration statements can precede
 *     clMultipleValueCall() in the enclosing code block.  Id must be
 *     unique with respect to clMultipleValueCall id's of overlapping
 *     scope.
 *   IMPLEMENTATION MODIFIES: CL_current_values.
 *   EFFECTS: Marks the start of a multiple value call.
 *   IMPLEMENTATION EFFECTS: Same as clSaveValues().
 *
 * clAccumulateValues(id:label)
 *   REQUIRES: id matches the id in a clMultipleValueCall(id) in the
 *     same code block.  The code preceding the clAccumulateValues() must
 *     produce multiple values.
 *   IMPLEMENTATION MODIFIES: CL_current_values.
 *   EFFECTS: Accumulates the previously produced multiple values for
 *     use in the current multiple value call.
 *   SIGNALS: Control-error if the total number of values collected
 *     for this multiple-value-call exceeds CALL-ARGUMENTS-LIMIT.
 *   IMPLEMENTATION EFFECTS: Advances CL_current_values to point to
 *     the next unused location in the multiple values buffer
 *     established by clMultipleValueCall().
 *
 * clMultipleValueMcall(id:label, f:clMFunction) => clObject
 *   REQUIRES: id matches the id in a clMultipleValueCall(id) in the
 *     same code block.  Multiple values must have been produced since
 *     this clMultipleValueCall(id), and accumulated with
 *     clAccumulateValues(id).
 *   IMPLEMENTATION MODIFIES: CL_current_values.
 *   EFFECTS: Calls the specified C function on the accumulated values,
 *     returning the result.  Multiple values produced by the called
 *     function are considered to be the values produced by the entire
 *     clMultipleValueCall() code block.
 *   IMPLEMENTATION EFFECTS: Similar to clRestoreValues(), but any
 *     values produced prior to the clMultipleValueCall() are replaced
 *     with the ones generated by the function call.
 *
 * clMultipleValueFuncall(id:label) => clObject
 *   REQUIRES: id matches the id in a clMultipleValueCall(id) in the
 *     same code block.  Multiple values must have been produced since
 *     this clMultipleValueCall(id), and accumulated with
 *     clAccumulateValues(id).
 *   IMPLEMENTATION MODIFIES: CL_current_values.
 *   EFFECTS: Calls the Lisp function object stored in id on the
 *     accumulated values, returning the result.  Multiple values
 *     produced by the called function are considered to be the values
 *     produced by the entire cl clMultipleValueCall() code block.
 *   IMPLEMENTATION EFFECTS: Similar to clRestoreValues(), but any
 *     values produced prior to the clMultipleValueCall() are replaced
 *     with the ones generated by the function call.
 *
 * Internal Operations:
 *
 * clPrimaryValue(id) => clObject
 *   REQUIRES: The desired values were the most recent ones produced.
 *     id is the identifier of the construct which produced the
 *     values. 
 *   EFFECTS: Retrieves the first multiple value, or clNIL if there
 *     were none. 
 *   IMPLEMENTATION EFFECTS: id is not actually used, but serves as
 *     documentation.

 *********************************************************************
 *	     PART III: EXITS AND THE DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT
 *	     -------------------------------------------
 *
 * Eclipse code uses the lexical C environment (i.e. the C stack) for
 * representing lexical information (i.e. local variables).  The use
 * of C functions to represent Lisp functions and return Lisp data has
 * been described in PART II, above.
 *
 * There are two other aspects of Lisp programming that require
 * additional support than what is defined by the C language:
 *
 *   - EXITS: Lisp defines constructs which specify that a body of
 *     code should be exited before reaching the end and that multiple
 *     values should be returned to some earlier point in the
 *     execution.  Unlike simply placing a C return statement in the
 *     middle of a function, these constructs allow returning to an
 *     abritrary point within any function which has not yet
 *     terminated -- including the one which contains the transfer.
 *     This is somewhat similar to the behavior of setjmp()/longjmp()
 *     in the C library.
 *
 *   - DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT: There is some information which obeys a
 *     similar stack discipline during execution to a lexical
 *     environment, but which is not lexically apparent to the
 *     compiler.  One example in C would be the temporary setting of
 *     global variables followed by resetting them back to their
 *     original value when the construct completes.  (The stack-like
 *     behavior becomes apparent with nested temporary settings.)
 *     Lisp provides a number of constructs for doing things to the
 *     dynamic environment and later undoing them.
 *
 * The C setjmp()/longjmp() facility restores the lexical environment,
 * but knows nothing about the dynamic environment.  Our mechanisms
 * for exits must not only restore the lexical environment, but the
 * dynamic environment as well.  For example, an exit out of a
 * construct which temporarilly bound dynamic variables must cause the
 * variables to be reset to values they had at the point we exit back
 * to.
 *
 * Thus the exit and dynamic environment machinery must work together. 
 *********************************************************************/
/********************************************************************* 
 * EXITS
 *
 * An clExitCell represents the state of execution of the machine at a
 * particular point, including:
 *   - The contents of the machine registers and execution stack
 *     (lexical environment).
 *   - The dynamic environment.
 *   - Information about where multiple values, if any, are to be
 *     placed. 
 * A transfer of control or "jump" can be performed based on the
 * information in an clExitCell.  Execution will continue at the point
 * the exit was established, with the original dynamic environment.
 *
 * The construct which establishes an exit must not have terminated
 * when control is transferred back to the exit.
 *
 * Implementation:
 *
 * Since the establishing construct must not have returned, the
 * clExitCell can be stored on the C stack.  In addition, it means
 * that the C library setjmp()/longjmp() pairs can be used for the
 * actual transfer of control.
 *
 * The following utilities are used by other constructs which
 * establish exits or transfer control to them.  The process of
 * actually transferring control is discussed later.
 *
 * We actually use _setjmp()/_longjmp() where available, rather than
 * setjmp()/longjmp().  Even so, the performance varies considerable
 * by system.  _setjmp()/_longjmp() appears to be particularly slow on
 * some SPARCs.
 *
 * Internal operations:
 *
 * clEstablishExit(id:identifier)
 *   REQUIRES: Only declaration statements can precede
 *     clEstablishExit() in the enclosing code block.  Id must be
 *     unique with respect to variables of overlapping scope.
 *   EFFECTS: Sets up id as an clExitCell variable which stores
 *     information about the current machine state.  An
 *     clUnwindExit(&id) will restore this state.  
 *   IMPLEMENTATION-EFFECTS: Caches the CL_current_values pointer in
 *     the exit for later use by clReceivesValues()
 *
 * clFinalizeExit(exit:clExitCell) => int
 *   REQUIRES: exit must be an clExitCell established with
 *     clEstablishExit.  No other clFinalizeExit() may be made to the
 *     same exit.  Any instructions between the clEstablishExit() and
 *     the clFinalizeExit() must have no net effect on the dynamic
 *     environment.
 *   EFFECTS: Ordinarilly returns 0.  However, if a transfer of control
 *     to exit is later made, the effect of that transfer is that the
 *     call to clFinalizeExit() returns a SECOND time, with a non-zero
 *     value. The particular non-zero value is defined by
 *     clDefineExitFlag().  See 'man setjmp'.
 *
 * clDefineExitFlag(exit:clExitCell, val:unsigned short)
 *   REQUIRES: Exit must be an active clExitCell established by
 *     clEstablishExit().  val must nonzero. 
 *   MODIFIES: Exit.
 *   EFFECTS: Defines the value clFinalizeExit(exit) will return if a
 *     transfer of control is made to exit.  This is normally 1.
 *     Currently, only clGo() uses this to return a different value,
 *     in which case the different val's are used to indicate
 *     different labels to go to.
 *
 * clReceivesValues(exit:clExitCell)
 *   REQUIRES: Exit must be an active clExitCell.  Multiple values
 *     must be produced after the clReceivesValues(exit) and before
 *     the transfer of control to the exit.
 *   IMPLEMENTATION MODIFIES: CL_current_values.
 *   EFFECTS: Prepares multiple values machinery so that after the
 *     transfer of control and the establishing clFinalizeExit()
 *     returns its non-zero value, any multiple values produced
 *     between clReceivesValues() and the transfer will be seen by
 *     receiving forms as though they were produced by
 *     clFinalizeExit().  See usage in clReturnFrom().
 *   IMPLEMENTATION EFFECTS: Sets CL_current_values to the value
 *     stored in the exit.

 *
 * A set of operations which establish an clExitCell and an clObject

 *
 * Example. The following code executes the code starting with the
 * call to usrFoo() and ends with the call to usrBar().  If we make it
 * that far, the variable x is set to the primary value returned by
 * usrBar().  In addition, FOO can be closed over like any clObject
 * variable, as shown in call to clMakeClosure.  If any
 * clReturnFrom(FOO, usrBaz(clEOA)) is executed between usrFoo() and
 * usrBar(), then x is set to the primary value returned by usrBaz(),
 * and we procede with the statement following clBlockEnd().
 *
 * { clBlock(FOO);
 *   if (clTrue((clReturned(FOO))) clSetq(x, (clReturnedValue(FOO)));
 *   else
 *     { usrFoo(clEOA);
 *       ... clMakeClosure(..., ..., ..., &FOO) ...;
 *       clSetq(x, usrBar(clEOA));
 *       clBlockEnd(FOO); } }
 *
 * Operations:
 *
 * clBlock(id:label)       
 *   REQUIRES: Only declaration statements can precede clBlock() in
 *     the enclosing code block.  id must be unique with respect to
 *     clBlocks and clTagbodies of overlapping scope.
 *   EFFECTS: Defines id to be an clObject variable representing
 *     information about the current state of execution.  This
 *     information is used by clReturnFrom(). Label may be closed over
 *     like any clObject variable.  However, id is not tagged, so it
 *     may not be examined by arbitrary Lisp operations.
 *   IMPLEMENTATION EFFECTS: Establishes an clExitCell. See
 *     clEstablishExit(). 
 *
 * clReturned(id:label) => clObject
 *   REQUIRES: id must first be established by a corresponding
 *     clBlock(id).  Any statements appearing between the
 *     clBlock() and the clReturned() must have no net effect on the
 *     dynamic environment.
 *   EFFECTS: Returns false.  However, if a clReturnFrom() is later
 *     executed to this id, the effect is that clReturned() returns a
 *     second time with a value of true.  
 *   IMPLEMENTATION EFFECTS: See clFinalizeExit()
 *
 * clReturnedValue(id:label) => clObject
 *   REQUIRES: clReturned(id) must have returned true.
 *   EFFECTS: Returns the primary value produced by the clReturnFrom()
 *     which caused clReturned() to become true. Note that
 *     clReturnFrom() produces multiple values. 
 *
 * clBlockEnd(id:label)
 *   OVERVIEW: Marks the end of a block for use with clLocalReturn().
 *     It can coexist with clBlock(), but clBlockEnd() does not
 *     require a corresponding clBlock(), and vice versa.
 *   REQUIRES: id must be unique with respect to different clBlocks in
 *     the same function.  However, id should be the same as the id in
 *     a clBlock(id) which corresponds to the same exit.  Note that
 *     the uniqueness requirement is slightly different than that for
 *     clBlock().
 *   EFFECTS: If a clLocalReturn(id) is executed within the same
 *     function, execution continues at the instruction following the
 *     clBlockEnd().  See clLocalReturn().

 *     with respect to clBlocks and clTagbodies of overlapping scope.
 *   EFFECTS: Defines id to be an clObject variable representing
 *     information about the current state of execution.  This
 *     information is used by clGo().  Label may be closed over like
 *     any clObject variable.  However, id is not tagged, so it may
 *     not be examined by arbitrary Lisp operations.
 *   IMPLEMENTATION EFFECTS: Establishes an clExitCell. See clBlock().
 *
 * clDefineLabel(label, n:unsigned short)
 *   REQUIRES: Preceding statement must be either clTagbody() or
 *     clDefineLabel().  A goto label matching the argument label must
 *     appear between clTagbodyStart() and clTagbodyEnd().  n must be
 *     a compile time constant greater than 0.
 *   EFFECTS: Causes transfer of control to the statement following
 *     the corresponding label when a clGo(id, n) is used, where id is
 *     the clObject established by clTagbody and n is the second
 *     argument to clDefineLabel().
 *
 * clTagbodyStart(id:label)
 *   REQUIRES: Preceding statement must be clDefineLabel().  id must
 *     match that used in clTagbody(). 
 *   EFFECTS: Part of clTagbody() syntax.  Establishes beginning of
 *     tagbody code. 
 *
 * clTagbodyEnd(id:label)
 *   REQUIRES: id just match that used in clTagbody().
 *   EFFECTS: Part of enclose_labels syntax.  Establishes end of
 *     tagbody code. 
 *
 * Implementation:
 *
 * The underlying clExitCell mechanism is identical to that used by
 * clBlock().  The two difference is that instead of a simple two-way
 * if, based on the value returned by clFinalizeExit(), we have a
 * different branch for each label in the tagbody.  clFinalizeExit()
 * cannot return a label name, but it can return a small integer.
 * Therefore, we switch on the integer value returned by
 * clFinalizeExit, with the case 0 being the "normal" tagbody code
 * (including labels), and the other cases being hardcoded branches to
 * the various labels.  The correspondence between labels and integers
 * is done with clDefineLabel().

/*********************************************************************
 * THE DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT
 *
 * Various constructs alter the dynamic environment when they are
 * entered, and restore the environment when they are exited.
 *
 * The act of leaving a dynamic-environment-effecting construct and
 * undoing its effects on the environment is called unwinding.  This
 * happens when we fall out the bottom of a construct which effects
 * the dynamic environment and we wish to restore the environment
 * before continuing with the next instruction.  Unwinding also
 * happens when we transfer control to an clExitCell and we wish to
 * restore the environment to that which was in effect when the exit
 * was established.
 *
 * Information is stored in the dynamic environment in such a way that
 * it can be unwound by a different construct than that which stored
 * the information.
 *
 * For example, Eclipse uses shallow binding for special variables --
 * each symbol has a value field which always hold the current value
 * of the symbol.  A construct which dynamically binds a special
 * variable must store the symbol and its original value in the
 * dynamic environment before assigning new data to the value field.
 *
 * If the only way to leave the binding construct was to fall out the
 * bottom, then the code generated for that construct could simply
 * reset the value at the end.  It would not need to represent the
 * information in a dynamic environment, but could have instead kept
 * track of information in its own lexical environment.
 *
 * Now suppose that during the execution of the binding construct, we
 * call some other function which determines that it needs to unwind
 * the dynamic environment to an earlier state -- one which is before
 * the special variables were bound.  When the called function was
 * defined, the compiler did not know that the function might be
 * called within a construct which bound special variables, so it
 * could not have compiled-in lexical references to information about
 * which symbols need to have which values reset.  The information in
 * the dynamic environment is represented in such a way that the
 * unwinding code can always find the information, and, morever, that
 * it can determine at run-time what information needs to be looked
 * for.
 *
 * The types of information which can be represented in the dynamic
 * environment (and unwound) are:
 *  
 *   - Symbols which have been dynamically bound, and their original
 *     values.
 *
 *   - The fact that an operation (progv) bound a particular number of
 *     symbols in one operation.  The number of symbols is determined
 *     at run-time and thus must be stored dynamically.
 *
 *   - A named clExitCell, called a catch.  One way way of
 *     transferring control to an clExitCell involves locating a catch
 *     with a particular name in the dynamic environment.
 *
 *   - A set of instructions, called a cleanup, which are to be
 *     executed when unwinding to an earlier state.  The cleanup
 *     instructions are executed in the lexical and dynamic
 *     environments that were in effect when the cleanup was
 *     established -- i.e. not the environment of the construct which
 *     initiated the unwinding, and not the environment being unwound
 *     to.  After the instructions have executed, unwinding continues,
 *     possibly executing additional cleanups before reaching the
 *     ultimate unwound dynamic state.
 *********************************************************************/
/*********************************************************************
 * DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT IMPLEMENTATION
 * 
 * A dynamic environment is only valid during the dynamic execution of
 * the construct which creates it.  This means, for example, that no
 * function can establish a new dynamic environment and return a
 * pointer to that environment.  Once the establishing function
 * terminates, the environment cannot be used.
 *
 * A consequence of this is that the normal C stack can be used, when
 * necessary, to hold new parts of the environment.  The memory is
 * then reclaimed when the code block terminates.
 *
 * Each construct which executes an unwindable operation on the
 * dynamic environment requires that at least one control object be
 * represented in the dynamic environment.  The type of the control
 * object indicates the operation, and the data needed to unwind the
 * operation are stored within the control object.  In some cases that
 * control object (or objects) will already exist.  In other cases,
 * the construct will allocate the object on the C stack as a lexical
 * variable.
 *
 * In any case, the dynamic environment represents a stack of control
 * operations as an array of clControlOpCells, where a clControlOpCell
 * is a pointer to a control object.  CL_dynamic_environment always
 * points to the current dynamic environment, i.e. the highest active
 * clControlOpCell.
 *
 * A clDynamicEnv is an index into the stack of clControlOpCells.  In
 * principle, the stack can grow beyond its initial size, which means
 * it can move.  Thus an index must be used to reference a particular
 * dynamic environment, rather than a machine memory pointer.  (The
 * #define parameter EXPANDABLE_CONTROL_STACK controls whether this is
 * really true.)
 *
 * Operations:
 *
 * clCurrentDEnv() => clDynamicEnv
 *   EFFECTS: Returns a clDynamicEnv representing the current dynamic
 *     environment.  
 *
 * clExtendControls(n:unsigned)
 *   MODIFIES: A new dynamic environment is made current. The stack of
 *     clControlOpCells is reallocated if necesary (depending on
 *     EXPANDABLE_CONTROL_STACK). 
 *   EFFECTS: The new dynamic environment has space for n control
 *     operations. 
 *
 * clUnwind(n:unsigned)
 *   REQUIRES: The current dynamic environment must have at least n
 *     control operations.  None of the elements can be a
 *     clCleanupCell. 
 *   IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRES: clUnwind does NOT restore multiple
 *     values to those defined at the point of the exit.  It may be
 *     necessary to use clRestoreValues() after clUnwind().
 *   MODIFIES: The dynamic environment.
 *   EFFECTS: Unwinds the n most recently added control operations
 *     from the dynamic environment.  As each operation is removed, the
 *     corresponding control object is examined and the appropriate
 *     unwinding side-effect is performed.
 *   IMPLEMENTATION: clUnwind() returns to the place where it was
 *     called.  The implementation of cleanups does not allow
 *     unwinding a cleanup to return. clUnwindExit() must be used
 *     instead.
 *
 * clUnwindExit(clExitCell *) => does not return
 *   REQUIRES: The construct which established the clExitCell must not
 *     have returned. 
 *   IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRES: clUnwindExit does NOT restore multiple
 *     values to those defined at the point of the exit (i.e. it does
 *     not reset the CL_current_values pointer).  An exit out of some
 *     multiple-values effecting construct will leave the
 *     multiple values machinery in an unkown state.  The Eclipse
 *     constructs that use clUnwindExit() all use clReceivesValues().
 *   MODIFIES: The dynamic environment.
 *   EFFECTS:  Unwinds sucessively older conrol operations from the
 *     dynamic environment until the environment matches that which
 *     was in force when the clExitCell was established.  As each
 *     control operation is removed, the control object is examined
 *     and the appropriate unwinding side-effect is performed.  This
 *     includes the execution of cleanups.  Finally, a transfer of
 *     control is made to the argument clExitCell.
 *   IMPLEMENTATION: See clUnwindProtect.
 *
 * clRemoveControlOp()
 *   REQUIRES: The current dynamic environment contains a single
 *     control operation which does not require any action to be
 *     unwound.  The only such examples are a single cleanup which has
 *     already finished executing or a single catch.
 *   MODIFIES: The previous dynamic environment is made current.
 *   EFFECTS: Removes the single most recent control operation from
 *     the dynamic environment without performing any unwinding
 *     action.  This may be more efficient than clUnwind(1).
 *   IMPLEMENTATION: Post-decrements dynamic environment pointer, so
 *     the previous control object is actually returned.

 * CATCH
 *
 * A set of operations which establish a tagged clExitCell in the

 *  2. The catch is known in the dynamic environment, not the lexical

 *  3. clEndCatch() is necessary, not optional, to disestablish the

 *
 * Operations:
 *
 * clCatch(id:label)       
 *   REQUIRES: Only declaration statements can precede clCatch() in

 *     any clCatch with overlapping scope.  A matching clEndCatch() is
 *     required.
 *   EFFECTS:  Prepares to  represent the current state of execution
 *     in the dynamic environment.
 *   IMPLEMENTATION EFFECTS: Establishes an clExitCell. See
 *     clEstablishExit(). 
 *
 * clThrown(id:label) => clObject
 *   REQUIRES: id must first be established by a corresponding
 *     clCatch(id).  Any statements appearing between the clCatch()
 *     and the clThrown() must have no net effect on the dynamic
 *     environment.
 *   EFFECTS: Returns false.  However, if a clThrow() is later
 *     executed to this id before the corresponding clEndCatch() is
 *     reached, the effect is that clThrown() returns a second time
 *     with a value of true. 
 *   IMPLEMENTATION EFFECTS: See clFinalizeExit()
 *   IMPLEMENTATION: A clCatchCell is stack allocated by clCatch().
 *     clThrown() adds the clCatchCell to the dynamic environment.  It
 *     is important that this not be done earlier, because any clThrow
 *     executed during the evaluation of the catch tag should not see
 *     this new catch.  The effect of encountering a clCatchCell

 *
 * clThrownValue(id:label) => clObject

 *   EFFECTS: Returns the primary value produced by the clThrow()
 *     which caused clThrown() to become true.  Note that clThrown()
 *     produces multiple values.
 *
 * clEndCatch(id:label)
 *   REQUIRES: Must be the last statement in a body of code which only

 * CLEANUPS
 *
 * clUnwindProtect() is essentially the same behavior as
 * clMultipleValueProg1(), except the second group of statements is

 * initiates a transfer of control to an earlier exit point.
 *
 * This is very general in that the the transfer may be initiated from
 * any function executing within the protected code -- i.e. the
 * cleanups are dynamic.  clUnwindProtect constructs may also be
 * nested.  A transfer of control out of all of the nested constructs
 * executes all the cleanup code, in the reverse order they were
 * established.
 *
 * Example.  The following executes usrProtectedFunction() and then
 * usrCleanupCode().  The multiple values produced by
 * usrProtectedFunction() are the ones seen by any surrounding
 * multiple value receiving code.  If usrProtectedFunction() doesn't
 * finish executing because of a clThrow, clReturnFrom, or clGo, the
 * clCleanupCode will still be executed.
 *
 * { clUnwindProtect(t_UNWIND);
 *   usrProtectedFunction(clEOA); 
 *   clCleanupStart(t_UNWIND);
 *   usrCleanupCode(clEOA); 
 *   clCleanupEnd(t_UNWIND); }
 *
 * Operations:
 * 
 * clUnwindProtect(id:label)
 *   REQUIRES: Only declaration statements can precede
 *     clUnwindProtect() in the enclosing code block.  id must be
 *     unique with respect to any clUnwindProtect() with overlapping
 *     scope.  A matching clCleanupEnd() is required.  The code
 *     between the clUnwindProtect() and the corresponding
 *     clCleanupStart() must produce multiple values.
 *   EFFECTS: Marks the started of protected code. Establishes that
 *     the code between the matching clCleanupStart() and
 *     clCleanupEnd() will always be executed after the protected code
 *     -- even if the preceding code initiates a transfer of control
 *     out to an earlier exit point.
 * 
 * clCleanupStart(id:label)
 *   REQUIRES: id must match that in an clUnwindProtect() in the same
 *     code block.
 *   EFFECTS: Marks the end of the protected code and the start of the
 *     cleanup code.
 *
 * clCleanupEnd(id:label)
 *   REQUIRES: id must match that in a a clCleanupStart() in the same
 *     code block.
 *   EFFECTS: Marks the end of the cleanup code.  If the cleanup code
 *     was entered normally, (that is, not from a transfer of control
 *     out of the protected code,) then the multiple values produced
 *     by the protected code will still be valid after the
 *     clCleanupEnd().
 *
 * Implementation:
 *
 * A clCleanupCell is stack allocated by clUnwindProtect() and entered
 * into the dynamic environment.  The clCleanupCell holds a jmp_buf
 * which is initialized with setjmp() before starting the protected
 * code.  The value returned by setjmp() is saved for later.  If 0,
 * (the normal case,) we begin executing the protected code.
 * (Otherwise we jump past it, as described below.)
 *
 * If the protected code terminates normally, we pop the clCleanupCell
 * from the dynamic environment, save any multiple values, and proceed
 * with the cleanup code.  If exection was normal, the setjmp return
 * value we saved earlier will be 0, so we just restore the multiple
 * values and we're done.
 *
 * Suppose clUnwindExit() is executed during the protected code.
 * clUnwindExit() is passed a pointer to an clExitCell, which tells it
 * when to stop unwinding and where to jump to when finished.  If
 * clUnwindExit() should encounter our clCleanupCell, it pops it off
 * and does a longjmp() to the jmp_buf we stored there.  It passes the
 * clExitCell pointer as the second argument to longjmp().  Thus this
 * call to clUnwindExit() never completes.
 *
 * This gets us back the lexical and dynamic environment of the
 * clUnwindProtect().  (The dynamic environment is correct because
 * clUnwindExit() already unwound any other intervening operations.)
 * Now the result of the the clUnwindProtect()'s setjmp() is non-zero
 * (the clExitCell pointer), so we jump past the protected form and go
 * to the cleanup code.
 *
 * At this point, the cleanup forms execute normally, including the
 * saving and restoring of multiple values.  When we get to the end,
 * we recognize that the saved setjmp() value is non-zero and we
 * execute a NEW clUnwindExit() with this pointer as argument.

 * unwound back to its state at the establishment of the exit.
 *
 * Examples: clGo(t_TAGBODY, 2); 
 *           clGo(clEnv(3, x), 2);
 *
 * clGo(id:clObject, n:unsigned short) => does not return
 *   REQUIRES:  id must refer to the same clObject defined by id in
 *     clTagbody(id).  n must evaluate to one of the integers used in
 *     a clDefineLabel() in that clTagbody().  The expression for id
 *     must not produce side-effects.
 *   EFFECTS: Transfers control to the label defined with n in the
 *     corresponding clTagbody().  After the transfer, the lexical and
 *     dynamic environments will be the ones in force at the
 *     establishment of the clTagbody().
 *   IMPLEMENTATION EFFECTS: Calls clReceivesValues() before
 *     unwinding.  Even though clGo() does not actually produce
 *     values, we have no way of knowing if we are exiting out of an
 *     execution path which modified the multiple values machinery
 *     (ex. a multiple-value-call or the value expression of a throw).
 *     If the tagbody was executing as part of the calculations of an
 *     argument for a multiple-value-call, we would loose the argument
 *     values accumulate thus far.  clReceivesValues() makes sure that
 *     doesn't occur by resetting the multiple values machinery back
 *     to the state it had at the entrance to the tagbody.

/*********************************************************************
 * RETURN-FROM
 *
 * Performs a transfer of control to an exit defined in the lexical
 * environment.  The exit is established by clBlock().  Multiple
 * values are returned to the block.  As with all transfers to exits,
 * the dynamic environment is unwound back to its state at the
 * establishment of the exit.
 *
 * Examples.  This code returns the single value I_9 (the fixnum 9) from
 * the end of the clBlock established with the name FOO.
 *
 *   clReturnFrom(FOO, clValues1(I_9));
 *
 * This does the same, where FOO was captured as the third binding in
 * the captured lexical environment:
 *
 *   clReturnFrom(clEnv(2, x), clValues1(I_9));
 *
 * When it is desired to simply jump to the end of a block, it may be
 * more efficient to use clLocalReturn().  Strictly speaking, this is
 * not a transfer to an exit because no unwinding of the dynamic
 * environment is performed.
 *
 * Example: clLocalReturn(FOO);
 *
 * Operations:
 *
 * clReturnFrom(id:clObject, val) => does not return
 *   REQUIRES: id must refer to the same clObject defined by id in
 *     clBlock(id).  val must be an expression which produces multiple
 *     values.  The expression for id must not produce side-effects.
 *   EFFECTS: Evaluates val and transfers control to the matching
 *     clBlock.   After the transfer, any multiple values produced by
 *     val will be visible to receiving forms as though they had been
 *     produced by clReturnedValue().
 *
 * clLocalReturn(id:label) => does not return
 *   REQUIRES: id must match the id in an clBlockEnd in the same code
 *     block.
 *   IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRES: If block being returned to is producing
 *     multiple values, then clLocalReturn() must not be executed from
 *     within a multiple values effecting construct, such as a
 *     multiple-value-call or a throw.
 *   EFFECTS: Transfers control to the statement following the
 *     matching clBlockEnd(). Note that no values are returned and no
 *     unwinding of the dynamic environment is performed. 
 *   USAGE: To return-from a block within the current function, and
 *     between which their are no intervening unwind-protects, it may
 *     be more efficient to use clLocalReturn() then clReturnFrom().
 *     However, it us up to the user to assign result values and
 *     clUnwind() as necessary.  Note that a clLocalReturn() requires
 *     a matching clBlockEnd(), but it does not require a matching
 *     clBlock().
 *   RATIONALE: Certainly, one could just define an end-block label
 *     and use a goto.  However:
 *      1. It is possible for a block to have both clReturnFrom() and
 *         clLocalReturn().  If there is a clReturnFrom(), there must
 *         be a clBlock(), and clBlock() uses the block name for an
 *         clObject variable.  Thus we can't use the block name
 *         directly for the label.  clBlockEnd(name) provides this
 *         abstraction.
 *      2. The current implementation of clBlock() does not require an
 *         clBlockEnd(), but clCatch() does require an clEndCatch().
 *         If the implementation were to change, it would be nice to
 *         have clBlockEnd() already defined.
 *      3. The usual C operation of goto label is a little general.
 *         It doesn't imply anything about why the transfer is made.
 *         The names of the pair clBlockEnd(FOO)/clLocalReturn(FOO)
 *         make the meaning clearer.

/*********************************************************************
 * THROW
 *
 * Performs a transfer of control to a named exit found in the dynamic
 * environment.  The exit is established by clCatch().  Multiple
 * values produced by the throw are seen by the catch.  As with all
 * transfers to exits, the dynamic environment is unwound back to its
 * state at the establishment of the exit.
 *
 * Example.  This code throws the single value I_9 (the fixnum 9) to
 * the clCatch established with the tag clFOO (the symbol FOO).
 *
 * { clThrow(t_THROW);
 *   clSetq(t_THROW, clFOO);      
 *   clFindCatcher(t_THROW);
 *   clExitThrow(t_THROW, clValues1(I_9)); }
 *
 * Operations:
 *
 * clThrow(id:label)
 *   REQUIRES: Only declaration statements can precede clThrow() in 
 *     the enclosing code block.  id must be unique with respect to
 *     all clThrows of overlapping scope.
 *   EFFECTS: Part of the syntax of a throw.
 * 
 * clFindCatcher(id:label)
 *   REQUIRES: The id of the same id must have already
 *     been set with the desired catch tag.  The id must
 *     be in the same code block.
 *   SIGNALS: control-error if no matching catch is found.
 *   EFFECTS: Locates the most recent catch with the specified tag in
 *     the dynamic environment.  
 *   IMPLEMENTATION EFFECTS: Calls clReceiveValues() just before
 *     returning. 
 *
 * clExitThrow(id:label, val) => does not return
 *   REQUIRES: id must match the id of a previous clFindCatcher(id) in
 *     the same code block.  val must be an expression which produces
 *     multiple values.
 *   EFFECTS: Evaluates val and transfers control to the matching
 *     clCatch.   After the transfer, any multiple values produced by
 *     val will be visible to receiving forms as though they had been
 *     produced by clThrownValue().
 *
 * Implementation note:
 *
 * One might expect a simpler process.  Something expressible by:
 *
 * #define Throw(tag, val) 			\
 * { clThrow(x); clSetq(x, tag); 	\
 *   clFindCatcher(x); clExitThrow(x, val); }
 *
 * Instead, we break the parts up so that the assignment of the
 * id and the actual clExitThrow() may be involved in
 * complex statements.  These complex statements might involve nested
 * code blocks, if statements, other clCatch's, clBlock's, etc.
 *
 * Note that our implementation of multiple values would not allow
 * something like this:
 *
 * { clObject throw_tag, throw_val;
 *   clSetq(throw_tag, clFOO);
 *   clSetq(throw_val, clValues(I_9));
 *   Throw(throw_tag, throw_val); }
 *
 * The problem is that the multiple values would have to be copied by
 * Throw() to the place expected by the clCatch().  We avoid this
 * inefficient copying by making clFindCatcher() come before the
 * generation of the multiple values and having clFindCatcher() work
 * with the multiple values machinery so that the values are written
 * to the correct place to begin with.
 *
 * Note that clReturnFrom() and clGo() expand into code like:
 *   (clReceivesValues(...), val, clUnwindExit(...))
 * while clExitThrow() skips the clReceivesValues().  The reason is
 * that for throw,, we don't know at compile time where the pointer to
 * the multiple values buffer is.  clFindCatch() locates this and sets
 * us up to receive multiple values.

 *
